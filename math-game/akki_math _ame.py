# by using if statment, example:  if fixiing1>=5 then break to break while loop 
# so this is statmet to break but for activating it any where in code we use
# this simple statment fixing+=10 so while loop will break even we are using nested while loop we can break the first and secend any while loop we want to from anywhere..
